//Basically we can assign with =

{
    let num=25;

    console.log(`The value of num is assigned with =`,num);
}


//we can use shorthand version of assignment like 
{
 let num1=5;
 let num2=40;
 num1+=num2;
//simply it is num1=num1+num2
 
 console.log(num1);

}

//ternary operators is also can used as assignment operator

{
    let x= (true)? "true":"false" ;

    console.log("The value assigned via ternary opeartors",x);
}
